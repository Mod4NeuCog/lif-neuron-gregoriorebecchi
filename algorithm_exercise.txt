1st exercise: 

Input: no input
Output: no output 
Function: neuron_increase(): 
-->neuron changes its membrane potential value

MainProgram Spike_without_inputs ()
	Declaration initial_potential (floating.point, -70)
			
Start

End


2nd exercise

Input: membrane_potential_increase (floating.point, from command line)
output: no output

Function: neuron_spike(): 
-->neuron passes its threshold value and inverts its membrane potential which becomes positive
